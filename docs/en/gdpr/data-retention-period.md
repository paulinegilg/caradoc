# How long should data be kept?

data must be kept for as long as is necessary to **satisfy the objectives
purposes** for which it was collected, as well as to comply with any **legal obligations** or
particular requirements**.

The data controller must determine a **fixed retention period** or an **objective criterion** for determining this period.
to determine this duration. For example, the duration of a contractual relationship with a customer.

For example, in the case of an Internet purchase, the customer's bank details need only be kept for the duration of the payment transaction.

After this period, the data must be **deleted**, **anonymized** or **archived**.

## Data anonymization

Anonymization involves altering data in such a way that it can no longer be used to re-identify individuals.
The data is then no longer considered personal.
They can be freely kept as they are, for statistical purposes for example.

## Data archiving

### The data retention cycle

The data retention cycle can be divided into **three distinct successive phases**:

#### The active database

The active database is the one used to achieve the processing objectives.
The data is accessible to operational departments so that they can fulfill these objectives.

### Intermediate archiving

In certain cases, it may be justified to keep data for longer periods.
For example, for **legal reasons**, if the data is of **administrative interest** (in the event of litigation) or for **archival purposes** in the **public interest**.

In such cases, the data will be stored on a separate database, with **restricted access**.

### Final archiving

Some data may not be destroyed or anonymized: this is the case for data deemed to be in the public interest.
These data are permanently archived and managed by the **archives territoriales**.
