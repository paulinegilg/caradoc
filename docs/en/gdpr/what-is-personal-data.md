For example: a name, a photo, a fingerprint, a postal address, an e-mail address, a telephone number, a social security number,
a professional number, an IP address, a computer connection identifier, a voice recording, etc.

Some data is considered "sensitive", but we'll come back to this later.

## Identification of individuals

A natural person can be identified:

- **directly** (e.g. name)
- **indirectly** (e.g. telephone or license number, social security number, postal or e-mail address, voice, photo, video, etc.).

A natural person can be identified:

- **from a single piece of data** (e.g. name)
- **by cross-referencing a set of data** (for example: a woman living at such and such an address, born on such and such a day, and a member of such and such an association).
