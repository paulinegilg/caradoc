# Definitions around data processing

## Data processing

::: tip To remember
**Data processing** is any operation involving personal data, regardless of the method used.
For example, recording, organizing, storing, modifying, reconciling with other data or transmitting personal data.
:::

Simple **consultation** of data is also considered processing.

A processing operation is therefore **not just a file, a database or an Excel spreadsheet**.
It can also be a video surveillance system, a credit card payment system, a biometric recognition system, a smartphone application, and so on.

A **paper file organized** according to a filing plan, nominative paper forms or application files
in alphabetical or chronological order are also considered as personal data processing.

## The data controller

::: tip To remember
The **data controller** is the legal entity (company, municipality, etc.) or natural person who determines the purposes and means of data processing,
i.e. the purpose and the way in which it is carried out.
:::

In practice, this is generally the legal entity (company, local authority, etc.) embodied by its legal representative (chairman, mayor, etc.).

## The purpose of processing

::: tip To remember
**The purpose of processing** is the main aim of using personal data.
:::

Data is collected for a **well-defined** and **legitimate** purpose, and is not further processed in a way incompatible with this initial purpose.

Examples: recruitment management, payroll management, customer management, satisfaction surveys, premises monitoring, communication campaigns, etc.

Processing that differs from the initial objective cannot be carried out.
