# Data minimization

## Collect only the data you need

::: tip To remember
The principle of data minimization implies collecting **only** the data **strictly necessary** to meet the **defined purpose**,
i.e. the purpose of processing.

For example, to send a newsletter to someone, you don't need to know their first and last names, just their e-mail address.

## Think about the purpose of data collection

Before collecting any data, it's a good idea to think about the **utility** of doing so.
Which data are necessary for processing, and which are less so?

### Optional data

It is possible to collect data that is **optional**, but in this case, the data subjects must be **informed**.
The mandatory or optional nature of the data to be provided, and the consequences of not providing it, must be **clearly explained**.

### Data outside the purpose for which it was collected

Avoid collecting data for **statistical purposes** or for **future projects**, if this does not meet the purpose of the current processing.
For example, systematically and compulsorily requesting data such as age, gender or municipality of residence in order to compile a customer file.
This is **not GDPR-compliant**, increases the risks in the event of **data leakage** and **discredits** the company in question.
