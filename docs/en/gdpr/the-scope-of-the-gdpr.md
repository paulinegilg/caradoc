# The scope of the GDPR

## Establishment criterion

The RGPD applies to the processing of personal data carried out by **organizations established on EU territory**,
whether the processing takes place in the EU.

## Targeting criterion

The GDPR applies to the processing of personal data carried out by **organizations whose activity targets people who are in the EU**.

## What about outsourcing?

The data controllers described by the establishment and targeting criteria, as well as their possible subcontractors, are all affected by the RGPD.

The latter may be:

- **IT service providers** (hosting, maintenance), **digital services companies**, **IT security companies**.
- marketing or communications agencies**, or
- any organization offering a **service involving data processing** on behalf of another organization.

## Domestic exception

Note that the GDPR does not apply to data processing carried out in the course of **strictly personal** activities.
Example: a list of contacts for the organization of a birthday party.
