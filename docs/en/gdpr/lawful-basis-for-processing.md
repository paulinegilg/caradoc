# Lawful basis for processing

::: tip To remember
The lawful basis for processing is what **legally authorizes it**,
i.e. what gives an organization the right to process personal data.

To be **lawful**, a processing operation must be based on **at least one** of the **6 basis** described by the GDPR.
:::

## Legal obligation

Processing is necessary to comply with a **legal obligation that the data controller must respect**.
This obligation must be a text of EU law or the law of a member state.

It may concern processing carried out by both private and public bodies.

For example, tax declarations or recruitment (the employee must provide his or her social security number).

## Contract

Processing is **necessary for the performance of a contract** to which the data subject is a party, or for the performance of **pre-contractual** measures taken at the data subject's request.

Example: delivery, quotation.

## Public task

Processing is necessary for the performance of **official authority**.

Examples: school enrolment management, sports and cultural subsidies, crisis communications, etc.

## Legitimate interest

This basis concerns the pursuit of legitimate interests by the controller.

Processing must be based on a **balance** between the **interests of the controller** and the **rights and interests of the data subject**.

Processing must be necessary to achieve a **specific purpose**.
In this sense, it is the **least intrusive** lawful basis.

This lawful basis can **not** be invoked by **public organizations** as part of their mission.

Examples: video surveillance in a company, communication with members of an association, etc.

## Consent

In this case, processing is lawful when the consent of the data subject has been obtained.

This means that **you have to ask people for their authorization** before processing their personal data.

Consent is not always necessary. This lawful basis is used **only** if one of the other legal bases does not apply.

## Vital interests

Processing is necessary to safeguard the vital interests of the data subject or another natural person.

This basis can only be used when it is **impossible to use another basis**.

Examples: threat to life, physical inability to give consent, management of humanitarian issues, etc.
