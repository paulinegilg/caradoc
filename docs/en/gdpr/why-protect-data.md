# Why protect data?

## Privacy is a right

With the diversity and development of digital uses, protecting your privacy on the Internet is essential.

::: tip To remember
Everyone is concerned, because **everyone has a private life**.

Even if on the surface "we have nothing to hide"...

We all have desires, wishes, secrets, convictions, a sexual life, tastes, projects, credit,
housing or social benefits, medical records, political opinions, religious beliefs... and we must be able to decide whether to share them, and with whom.
:::

Protecting personal data means protecting the **intimacy**, **dignity** and **fundamental rights** of individuals, such as the right to privacy,
the right to image or the right to honor.
