# Fines and penalties

## What do you risk if you fail to comply with the GDPR?

Up to **20 million euros** or up to **4% of worldwide annual sales** in the case of a company. 
These penalties may be made **public**.

### The most expansive fine so far: Meta's 1.2 billion euros GDPR fine

Imposed by the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) in May 2022, it is the biggest fine so far under the GDPR law.

This record-breaking fine was issued for the transfer of personal data of European users to the US without adequate data protection mechanisms 
and serves as a significant milestone in data protection regulation.

This fine serves as a clear warning to other companies that the GDPRâ€™s requirements must be taken seriously, 
and non-compliance can result in severe financial consequences.

## Who ensures compliance with the GDPR?

GDPR compliance is guaranteed by 3 complementary players:

- The **Data Protection Commissions of the EU member states**: supports professionals in their compliance, helps individuals to control their data and exercise their rights.
- The **CEPD (European Data Protection Committee)**: coordinates the action of the EU's CNILs.
- The **CJEU (Court of Justice of the European Union)**: enforces legislation and sanctions non-compliant entities.
