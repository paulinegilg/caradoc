# About

My name is Pauline Gilg, and I'm a software developer based in Strasbourg.

I work in the IT department of the University of Strasbourg. I'm currently developing applications with Vue.
I'm also a lecturer in the CAWEB Master's program (Multilingual Web Communication), again at the University of Strasbourg.

Eternally curious, I love exploring and self-training in new languages and technologies.

I'm interested in personal data protection, accessibility, free software and the world of Linux.
